The code that I have written here will generate a password for you after a prompt appears asking you whether or not you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
The prompt will also ask you for a length for the password and will return a password of that length with a random combination of the selections that you chose above.
Once a password is generated based on the criteria above, my code will also show you what answers you chose as well as the length. 

Enjoy!
